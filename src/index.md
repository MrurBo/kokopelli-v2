## About Kokopelli

**Kokopelli Plant Medicine** was born from direct experience, not theory, trends, or branding.

This project grew out of a personal healing journey with plant medicine, where plants were approached not as products, but as teachers. That relationship shaped everything that followed: how medicines are sourced, prepared, spoken about, and shared.

Kokopelli exists to provide **ethical, respectful access** to traditional plant and earth medicines from around the world, including South America, India, Europe, and other regions where living plant knowledge is still carried through lineage and practice.

The medicines offered through Kokopelli are sourced directly from their place of origin, through relationships with people who work in traditional ways. **Preparation methods are respected. Intervention is kept minimal.** Nothing is rushed, stripped, or altered to fit convenience or trends.

This is not mass-market wellness.
It is not entertainment.
And it is not separated from responsibility.

We believe plant medicines carry power, and that power requires **education, grounding, and conscious use**. Kokopelli does not promote excess, escapism, or careless consumption. Instead, we emphasize intentional, informed, and respectful engagement, including awareness of cultural context and legal boundaries.

**Reciprocity matters.
Sustainability matters.
Transparency matters.
So does knowing when not to use something.**

Kokopelli stands for **slow medicine, honest sourcing, and long-term trust.**

Medicine that comes from the land.
Handled with care.
Shared with integrity.
